## Phase 3: Emulator Suite Integration (Days 16-26)

### 6. KMS Emulator Integration ⏳ Not Started
**Estimated:** 2-3 days

- [ ] Add IAM client to KMS emulator
- [ ] Check `IAM_EMULATOR_HOST` env var
- [ ] Call TestIamPermissions before each operation
- [ ] Map KMS methods to required permissions
- [ ] Return PERMISSION_DENIED on authz failure
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Update KMS emulator README

### 7. Secret Manager Emulator Integration ⏳ Not Started
**Estimated:** 2-3 days

- [ ] Add IAM client to Secret Manager emulator
- [ ] Check `IAM_EMULATOR_HOST` env var
- [ ] Call TestIamPermissions before each operation
- [ ] Map Secret Manager methods to required permissions
- [ ] Return PERMISSION_DENIED on authz failure
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Update Secret Manager emulator README

### 8. Full Stack Example ⏳ Not Started
**Estimated:** 1-2 days

- [ ] Create `docker-compose.yml` with all 3 emulators
- [ ] Create example `policy.yaml` for full stack
- [ ] Add end-to-end integration test script
- [ ] Document full stack setup in README
- [ ] Create "Quick Start" guide for the stack

---

## Phase 4: Documentation & Release (Days 27-30)

### 9. Documentation Updates ⏳ Not Started

- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md for v0.3.0
- [ ] Update README.md with new features
- [ ] Update FEATURES.md with v0.3.0 additions
- [ ] Create blog post: "Local GCP Stack with Real IAM"
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md to remove completed items

### 10. Testing & Quality ⏳ Not Started

- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Fix any linter warnings
- [ ] Performance test (condition evaluation overhead)
- [ ] Security review (CEL expression safety)
- [ ] CI pipeline verification

---

## Success Metrics

v0.3.0 is complete when:

1. ✅ Groups work in policy files and reduce duplication
2. ✅ Conditional bindings evaluate correctly with basic CEL
3. ✅ REST gateway serves all 3 IAM methods
4. ✅ Trace output includes condition evaluation results
5. ✅ KMS emulator enforces IAM permissions
6. ✅ Secret Manager emulator enforces IAM permissions
7. ✅ Docker Compose stack works end-to-end
8. ✅ All tests pass (unit + integration + e2e)
9. ✅ Documentation is complete and accurate
10. ✅ Release notes explain "Behaves like IAM. Debugs better than GCP."
